Title: RHSA-2019:1167: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)


Description: The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* A flaw was found in the implementation of the "fill buffer", a mechanism used by modern CPUs when a cache-miss is made on L1 CPU cache.  If an attacker can generate a load operation that would create a page fault, the execution will continue speculatively with incorrect data from the fill buffer while the data is fetched from higher level caches.  This response time can be measured to infer data in the fill buffer. (CVE-2018-12130)

* Modern Intel microprocessors implement hardware-level micro-optimizations to improve the performance of writing data back to CPU caches. The write operation is split into STA (STore Address) and STD (STore Data) sub-operations. These sub-operations allow the processor to hand-off address generation logic into these sub-operations for optimized writes. Both of these sub-operations write to a shared distributed processor structure called the 'processor store buffer'.  As a result, an unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to read private data resident within the CPU's processor store buffer. (CVE-2018-12126)

* Microprocessors use a ‘load port’ subcomponent to perform load operations from memory or IO. During a load operation, the load port receives data from the memory or IO subsystem and then provides the data to the CPU registers and operations in the CPU’s pipelines. Stale load operations results are stored in the 'load port' table until overwritten by newer operations. Certain load-port operations triggered by an attacker can be used to reveal data about previous stale requests leaking data back to the attacker via a timing side-channel. (CVE-2018-12127)

* Uncacheable memory on some microprocessors utilizing speculative execution may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via a side channel with local access. (CVE-2019-11091)

Title: RHSA-2019:1479: kernel security and bug fix update (Important)


Description: The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.

Security Fix(es):

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking subsystem processed TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) segments. While processing SACK segments, the Linux kernel's socket buffer (SKB) data structure becomes fragmented. Each fragment is about TCP maximum segment size (MSS) bytes. To efficiently process SACK blocks, the Linux kernel merges multiple fragmented SKBs into one, potentially overflowing the variable holding the number of segments. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the Linux kernel by sending a crafted sequence of SACK segments on a TCP connection with small value of TCP MSS, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). (CVE-2019-11477)

* kernel: lack of check for mmap minimum address in expand_downwards in mm/mmap.c leads to NULL pointer dereferences exploit on non-SMAP platforms (CVE-2019-9213)

* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption while processing SACK blocks allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11478)

* Kernel: tcp: excessive resource consumption for TCP connections with low MSS allows remote denial of service (CVE-2019-11479)

Description: Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

Security Fix(es):

* redis: Heap buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10192)

* redis: Stack buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10193)

The PKI installer "pkispawn" logs admin credentials into a
world-readable log file. It also looks like the installer is passing the
password as an insecure command line argument. The credentials are the
389-DS LDAP server's Directory Manager credentials. The Directory
Manager is 389-DS' equivalent of unrestricted root account. The user
bypasses permission checks and grants full access to data. In an IdM /
FreeIPA installation the DM user is able to read and manipulate Kerberos
KDC master password, Kerberos keytabs, hashed user passwords, and more.
Any and all IdM and FreeIPA installations with PKI 10.10 should be
considered compromised.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, OpenJDK's FIPS mode would be enabled if it detected that the system crypto policy was set to FIPS. This meant that containers running on a FIPS mode kernel would not enable FIPS mode without the crypto policy being changed. With this update, OpenJDK queries the NSS library as to whether FIPS mode is active or not. (RHBZ#2014201)

* The use of the NSS FIPS mode by OpenJDK requires the JDK to login to the NSS software token. Previously, this happened indirectly as part of some crypto operations, but not others. With this update, the JDK logs in to the token on initialisation. (RHBZ#2014204)

* While in FIPS mode, the NSS Software Token does not allow the import of private or secret plain keys. This caused the OpenJDK keytool application to fail when used with OpenJDK in FIPS mode. With this update, OpenJDK will now import such keys into the NSS database. This behaviour may be disabled using -Dcom.redhat.fips.plainKeySupport=false. (RHBZ#2014193)

* Developer environment: Unicode's bidirectional (BiDi) override characters can cause trojan source attacks (CVE-2021-42574)

The following changes were introduced in rust in order to facilitate detection of BiDi Unicode characters:

Rust introduces two new lints to detect and reject code containing the affected codepoints. These new deny-by-default lints detect affected codepoints in string literals and comments. The lints will prevent source code file containing these codepoints from being compiled. If your code has legitimate uses for the codepoints we recommend replacing them with the related escape sequence. The error messages will suggest the right escapes to use.

Description: The binutils packages provide a collection of binary utilities for the manipulation of object code in various object file formats. It includes the ar, as, gprof, ld, nm, objcopy, objdump, ranlib, readelf, size, strings, strip, and addr2line utilities.

Security Fix(es):

* Developer environment: Unicode's bidirectional (BiDi) override characters can cause trojan source attacks (CVE-2021-42574)

The following changes were introduced in binutils in order to facilitate detection of BiDi Unicode characters:

Tools which display names or strings (readelf, strings, nm, objdump) have a new command line option --unicode / -U which controls how Unicode characters are handled.

Using "--unicode=default" will treat them as normal for the tool. This is the default behaviour when --unicode option is not used.
Using "--unicode=locale" will display them according to the current locale.
Using "--unicode=hex" will display them as hex byte values.
Using "--unicode=escape" will display them as Unicode escape sequences.
Using "--unicode=highlight" will display them as Unicode escape sequences highlighted in red, if supported by the output device.

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previous Red Hat builds of OpenJDK 17 altered the arguments passed to sun.security.pkcs11.wrapper.PKCS11.getInstance() in order to facilitate FIPS support. This build adds an additional form of the method, retaining the original arguments, so that applications which depend on this internal method continue to function with Red Hat builds of OpenJDK. (BZ#2099913)

* With previous Red Hat builds of OpenJDK 17, Mac key generation and import would fail due to the lack of the CKA_SIGN attribute on the key. This attribute is now added as part of the NSS FIPS configuration. (BZ#2108190)

* With the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6, a change was made so that disabling OpenJDK FIPS mode required the use of both the -Djava.security.disableSystemPropertiesFile=true and -Dcom.redhat.fips=false options, with the intention that FIPS mode could be controlled independently of system security properties. This change has now been reverted and only -Djava.security.disableSystemPropertiesFile=true is required to disable FIPS mode, as in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. (BZ#2108206)

* Previous Red Hat builds of OpenJDK 17 running in FIPS mode with a SecurityManager would fail due to a lack of module access permissions. This has now been corrected. (BZ#2108209)

* Previously, the XML signature provider was unable to operate in FIPS mode. Following recent enhancements to FIPS mode support, the XML signature provider can now be supported. It is now enabled in FIPS mode. (RHBZ#2186827)

* The PKCS#11 provider used by FIPS mode can be supported by different PKCS#11 tokens. It was found that some PKCS#11 tokens may not be initialised fully before use, leading to an exception being thrown by the provider. With this release, this exception is now expected and handled by the FIPS support code. (RHBZ#2186831)

* Installing the same java-17-openjdk-headless package on two different systems resulted in distinct classes.jsa files getting generated. This was because the CDS archive was being generated by a post script action of the java-17-openjdk-headless package. This prevented the use of the dynamic dump feature, as the checksum in the archive would be different on each system. This is resolved in this release by using the .jsa files generated during the initial build. (RHBZ#2221655)

Description: The java-21-openjdk packages provide the OpenJDK 21 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 21 Java Software Development Kit.

Security Fix(es):

* OpenJDK: memory corruption issue on x86_64 with AVX-512 (8317121) (CVE-2023-22025)

* OpenJDK: certificate path validation issue during client authentication (8309966) (CVE-2023-22081)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Additional validity checks in the handling of Zip64 files, JDK-8302483, were introduced in the 21.0.0 release of OpenJDK, causing the use of some valid zip files to now fail with an error. This release, 21.0.1, allows for zero-length headers and additional padding produced by some Zip64 creation tools. With both releases, the checks can be disabled using -Djdk.util.zip.disableZip64ExtraFieldValidation=true.

* A maximum signature file size property, jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize, was introduced in the 20.0.0 release of OpenJDK by JDK-8300596, with a default of 8 MB. This default proved to be too small for some JAR files. This release, 20.0.1, increases it to 16 MB. (RHEL-14952)

* When Transparent Huge Pages (THP) are unconditionally enabled on a system, Java applications using many threads were found to have a large Resident Set Size (RSS). This was due to a race between the kernel transforming thread stack memory into huge pages and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) shattering these pages into smaller ones when adding a guard page. This release resolves this issue by getting glibc to insert a guard page and prevent the creation of huge pages. (RHEL-14961)

* Installing the same java-21-openjdk-headless package on two different systems resulted in distinct classes.jsa files getting generated. This was because the CDS archive was being generated by a post script action of the java-21-openjdk-headless package. This prevented the use of the dynamic dump feature, because the checksum in the archive would be different on each system. This release resolves this issue by using the .jsa files generated during the initial build. (RHEL-14944)

* The /usr/bin/jfr alternative is now owned by the java-21-openjdk package. (RHEL-14960)

* The jcmd tool is now provided by the java-21-openjdk-headless package, rather than java-21-openjdk-devel, to make it more accessible. (RHEL-14950)

Bug Fix(es):

* When Transparent Huge Pages (THP) are unconditionally enabled on a system, Java applications using many threads were found to have a large Resident Set Size (RSS). This was due to a race between the kernel transforming thread stack memory into huge pages and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) shattering these pages into smaller ones when adding a guard page. This release resolves this issue by getting glibc to insert a guard page and prevent the creation of huge pages. (RHEL-13930, RHEL-13931, RHEL-13934, RHEL-13935)

Title: RHSA-2024:1751: unbound security update (Important)


Description: The unbound packages provide a validating, recursive, and caching DNS or DNSSEC resolver.

Security Fix(es):

* A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. The default combination of the "control-use-cert: no" option with either explicit or implicit use of an IP address in the "control-interface" option could allow improper access. If a process can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows an unprivileged local process to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.

To mitigate the vulnerability, a new file "/etc/unbound/conf.d/remote-control.conf" has been added and included in the main unbound configuration file, "unbound.conf". The file contains two directives that should limit access to unbound.conf:

    control-interface: "/run/unbound/control"
    control-use-cert: "yes"

For details about these directives, run "man unbound.conf".

Updating to the version of unbound provided by this advisory should, in most cases, address the vulnerability. To verify that your configuration is not vulnerable, use the "unbound-control status | grep control" command. If the output contains "control(ssl)" or "control(namedpipe)", your configuration is not vulnerable. If the command output returns only "control", the configuration is vulnerable because it does not enforce access only to the unbound group members. To fix your configuration, add the line "include: /etc/unbound/conf.d/remote-control.conf" to the end of the file "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf". If you use a custom "/etc/unbound/conf.d/remote-control.conf" file, add the new directives to this file. (CVE-2024-1488)

Title: RHSA-2024:3271: bind and dhcp security update (Important)


Description: The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server is operating correctly.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast address. The dhcp packages provide a relay agent and ISC DHCP service required to enable and administer DHCP on a network.

Security Fix(es):

* bind9: Parsing large DNS messages may cause excessive CPU load (CVE-2023-4408)

* bind9: KeyTrap - Extreme CPU consumption in DNSSEC validator (CVE-2023-50387)

* bind9: Preparing an NSEC3 closest encloser proof can exhaust CPU resources (CVE-2023-50868)

Bug Fix:

* dhcp rebuilt after API change of bind-export-libs
